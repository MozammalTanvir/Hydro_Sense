## Our Challenge Name:
#### : Leveraging Earth Observation Data for Informed Agricultural Decision-Making
We are working on the Subject: Software
## Subject:
Farmers face significant water-related challenges from unpredictable weather, pests, and diseases, affecting crop health, profits, and food security. This tool aims to help farmers explore and analyze NASA datasets to address issues like droughts and floods, enabling them to improve their farming practices and mitigate the impact of extreme weather events.
## Our background:
1.Challenges faced by farmers: Unpredictable weather, pests, diseases, and political issues affect crop health, profitability, and food security, making farming more vulnerable.<br>
2.Need for innovative solutions: Farmers require tools that provide data-driven insights, such as NASA Earth data, to help them tackle water-related challenges without becoming data experts.
3.Satellite data application: Although there's growing interest in using satellite data for agriculture, translating this complex information into actionable insights for farmers remains difficult.
4.Limitations of traditional methods: Farmers often rely on experience and intuition, which may not be sufficient in addressing increasingly unpredictable environmental conditions.
5.Importance of a tailored tool: A solution designed to connect NASA Earth Observation data with farmersâ€™ needs would enhance resilience, sustainability, and decision-making in agricultural communities.
